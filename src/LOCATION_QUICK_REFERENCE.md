# üìç Location Detection - Quick Reference

## How Location Works Now

The app automatically detects your location using your **IP address** instead of GPS.

### What You'll See

```
‚úÖ App opens ‚Üí Location detected instantly (1-2 seconds)
‚úÖ Weather shows: "[Your City], Vietnam" or "[Your City], Vi·ªát Nam"
‚úÖ Real-time weather for your location
‚úÖ 5-day forecast
```

### No Action Required

‚ùå No permission prompts  
‚ùå No GPS needed  
‚ùå No manual location selection  
‚úÖ Just open the app and it works!

## Location Accuracy

| Type | Accuracy | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **IP Geolocation** | City-level (5-50 km) | ‚úÖ Weather forecast |
| **GPS** | Street-level (5-10 m) | ‚ùå Not needed for weather |

**For weather purposes, city-level accuracy is perfect!**

---

## Common Questions

### Why does it show a nearby city instead of my exact location?

This is normal! IP geolocation provides approximate city-level location:
- Based on your internet service provider's routing
- Accurate enough for weather data
- Weather conditions are the same across nearby areas

**Example**: If you're in a suburb of Ho Chi Minh City, it might show "Ho Chi Minh City" or the nearest major city. The weather forecast will still be accurate for your area.

### I'm using VPN - what happens?

The app will detect your **VPN server's location**:
- If VPN server is in Hanoi ‚Üí Shows Hanoi weather
- If VPN server is abroad ‚Üí Shows that country's weather

**Solution**: Disable VPN to see local weather, or the app will fall back to An Giang, Vietnam.

### I'm on a corporate network - why wrong location?

Corporate networks with proxies may show:
- Company headquarters location
- Proxy server location
- Regional office location

This is expected. Weather will still be relevant for that general area.

### Can I manually change my location?

Currently not available in this version. The app uses automatic IP-based detection only.

**Future enhancement**: Manual location selector may be added based on user feedback.

## Location Detection Process

```
1. App opens
   ‚Üì
2. IP address detected (automatic)
   ‚Üì
3. ip-api.com called
   ‚Üì
4. City & coordinates returned
   ‚Üì
5. Open-Meteo weather API called
   ‚Üì
6. Weather displayed with your city name
```

**Total time**: 1-2 seconds

---

## Fallback Behavior

If IP detection fails:

```
IP Detection Failed
   ‚Üì
Uses Default Location: An Giang, Vietnam
   ‚Üì
Weather still loads successfully
   ‚Üì
Can refresh to retry
```

**You'll never see an error** - weather always loads!

## What's Detected from IP

The app detects:
- ‚úÖ **City**: Your approximate city or region
- ‚úÖ **Country**: Vietnam (or your actual country)
- ‚úÖ **Coordinates**: Latitude & longitude for weather API
- ‚úÖ **Timezone**: For accurate time display

The app does NOT collect:
- ‚ùå Precise GPS coordinates
- ‚ùå Street address
- ‚ùå Building location
- ‚ùå Personal information
