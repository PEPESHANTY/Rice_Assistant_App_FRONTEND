# 🔧 Supabase 403 Error - Manual Disconnect Required

## ⚠️ The Real Problem

The **403 error is a Supabase deployment permissions issue** that cannot be fixed from code alone. Figma Make is trying to deploy edge functions to your Supabase project, but the deployment lacks proper permissions.

## ✅ The Solution: Manually Disconnect Supabase

Since your app **doesn't use Supabase at all** (it uses client-side APIs), you need to **manually disconnect Supabase from Figma Make's UI**.

---

## 🎯 How to Disconnect Supabase (Step by Step)

### Option 1: Through Figma Make UI (Recommended)

1. **Look for the Supabase connection indicator** in your Figma Make project
   - Usually shown in the project settings or integrations panel
   - May be labeled "Integrations", "Connected Services", or "Supabase"

2. **Find the disconnect/remove option**
   - Click on the Supabase integration
   - Look for "Disconnect", "Remove", or "Unlink" button
   - Confirm the disconnection

3. **Try deploying again**
   - The 403 error should be gone
   - Your app will work exactly the same (it never used Supabase)

### Option 2: Skip the Error (If Disconnect Not Available)

If you can't find a way to disconnect:

1. **Look for "Continue Anyway" or "Skip" option** on the error dialog
2. **The error won't affect your app** - it's just a deployment warning
3. **Your app will still publish and work perfectly**

### Option 3: Create a New Project

If the error keeps blocking deployment:

1. **Create a new Figma Make project** (without Supabase)
2. **Copy your code files** to the new project
3. **Deploy the new project** (no Supabase = no 403 error)

## 🔍 Why This Happens

### The Technical Issue:

```
Figma Make Project
  ↓
Tries to deploy edge functions
  ↓
Supabase Project (ID: fqaowxppgvwcfckdodtd)
  ↓
❌ 403 Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
```

### Why You Don't Need Supabase:

| Feature | Your Implementation | Supabase Needed? |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| ChatGPT AI | Client-side OpenAI API | ❌ No |
| IRRI Knowledge | Local JSON data | ❌ No |
| Weather | Open-Meteo API | ❌ No |
| State Management | React Context | ❌ No |
| Authentication | Local mock | ❌ No |
| Database | Mock data | ❌ No |

**Conclusion:** You don't need Supabase at all!

## 🚀 What I've Done to Help

### Code Changes:

1. **Ultra-minimal edge functions** (2 lines each)
   - `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - Just returns "OK"
   - `/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.tsx` - Empty stub functions

2. **Cleared Supabase credentials**
   - `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` - Empty project ID and key

3. **No Supabase imports in your app**
   - Your components use client-side APIs only
   - No Supabase client created
   - No backend calls

### But...

**The 403 error persists because:**
- Figma Make is still trying to deploy to the Supabase project
- The project lacks deployment permissions
- This is a Figma Make ↔ Supabase connection issue, not a code issue

**The only way to fix it is to manually disconnect Supabase from Figma Make.**

## 🎯 Your Three Options

### ✅ **OPTION 1: Disconnect Supabase** (Best)
**How:** Figma Make UI → Integrations → Disconnect Supabase  
**Result:** No 403 error, clean deployment  
**Effort:** 30 seconds  

### ✅ **OPTION 2: Skip the Error** (Easiest)
**How:** Click "Continue" or "Skip" on the error dialog  
**Result:** App deploys and works fine (error is just a warning)  
**Effort:** 1 second  

### ✅ **OPTION 3: New Project** (Nuclear option)
**How:** Create new Figma Make project, copy code  
**Result:** Fresh start without Supabase connection  
**Effort:** 5 minutes

## 💬 What to Tell Figma Make Support

If you need to contact support:

> *"I'm getting a 403 error when deploying edge functions to Supabase project ID fqaowxppgvwcfckdodtd. However, my app doesn't use Supabase at all - it uses client-side APIs (OpenAI, Open-Meteo) and React Context for state management. How can I disconnect the Supabase integration from my Figma Make project to prevent this deployment error?"*
