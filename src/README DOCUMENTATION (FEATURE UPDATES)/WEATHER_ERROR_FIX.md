## 🔍 Debugging Tools

### Console Logging
The app now logs detailed information:

**Startup**:
```
🚀 Real-time weather enabled! Using Open-Meteo API
```

**Location Detection**:
```
🌍 Requesting location permission...
✅ Location detected: 10.7769, 106.7009
```

**API Call**:
```
📍 Coordinates: 10.7769, 106.7009
🌐 Fetching from: https://api.open-meteo.com/...
```

**Success**:
```
✅ Weather data received: {...}
✅ Weather data loaded successfully for Ho Chi Minh City
```

**Error**:
```
❌ Failed to fetch weather data: TypeError: Load failed
Network error - check internet connection or CORS policy
🔄 Falling back to mock weather data
💡 App is using mock weather data (demo mode)
📖 See WEATHER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md for help
```

### Network Tab (DevTools)
1. Press F12
2. Click Network tab
3. Look for requests to `api.open-meteo.com`
4. Status should be 200 OK

## 🎯 Why You Might See the Error

The error `TypeError: Load failed` typically means:

### Most Common Causes:
1. **No internet connection** - Check wifi/data
2. **Firewall blocking** - Corporate networks often block APIs
3. **Ad blocker** - Some extensions block API calls
4. **Network timeout** - Slow or unstable connection
5. **DNS issues** - Cannot resolve open-meteo.com

### Less Common:
6. **CORS misconfiguration** - Browser security (rare with Open-Meteo)
7. **API temporarily down** - Very rare, 99.9% uptime
8. **SSL certificate issues** - Old browsers

## ✅ What to Do

### If You See the Error:

**Option 1: Ignore It** ✨
- App works perfectly with mock data
- All features functional
- Try refresh button later
- Not a critical error

**Option 2: Troubleshoot**
1. Check internet connection
2. Try different network
3. Disable ad blockers
4. Clear browser cache
5. See [WEATHER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./WEATHER_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

**Option 3: Test API Directly**
Open this URL in browser:
```
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=10.0452&longitude=105.4340&current=temperature_2m
```

If you see JSON data → API is working, check your app
If you get error → Network/firewall blocking API
