# üáªüá≥ Default Language: Vietnamese

## Summary

The application now defaults to **Vietnamese (VI)** language when it loads.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial Language State
The app starts with Vietnamese as the default language:
```typescript
const [language, setLanguage] = useState<'EN' | 'VI'>('VI');
```

### 2. User Login Default
When users log in, their language preference is set to Vietnamese:
```typescript
language: 'VI',
```

Mock user farm data is now in Vietnamese:
- Farm name: **"Trang Tr·∫°i Ch√≠nh"** (Main Farm)
- Location: **"T·ªânh An Giang, Vi·ªát Nam"** (An Giang Province, Vietnam)
- Plot A: **"L√¥ A"** with **"ƒê·∫•t S√©t Pha"** (Clay Loam) and **"T∆∞·ªõi Ng·∫≠p"** (Flood Irrigation)
- Plot B: **"L√¥ B"** with **"ƒê·∫•t Ph√π Sa"** (Alluvial) and **"T∆∞·ªõi Nh·ªè Gi·ªçt"** (Drip Irrigation)

### 3. User Signup Default
New users are created with Vietnamese as default language:
```typescript
language: userData.language || 'VI',
```

### 4. localStorage Fallback
If no language is stored in localStorage, defaults to Vietnamese:
```typescript
setLanguage(userData.language || 'VI');
```

## User Experience

### After Login/Signup

## Language Switching

Users can still switch to English by:
