## 🎯 **Smart Behavior**

### **Auto-Hide Logic:**
```typescript
// Show initial view only if 1 message (welcome only)
const showInitialView = messagesCount === 1;

if (showInitialView) {
  // Show topic cards or questions list
  return <TopicCards /> or <QuestionsList />;
}

// After conversation starts, show pill button with sheet
return <FloatingPillButton with BottomSheet />;
```

### **State Management:**
```typescript
const [selectedTopic, setSelectedTopic] = useState<Topic | null>(null);
const [sheetOpen, setSheetOpen] = useState(false);

// Selecting a topic in initial view
setSelectedTopic(topic) → Shows QuestionsList

// Clicking a question
onSelectQuestion(questionText) → Sends to chat
setSelectedTopic(null) → Resets to TopicCards
setSheetOpen(false) → Closes sheet if open
```

    [question.id]: (prev[question.id] || 0) + 1
  }));
  
  onSelectQuestion(question);
};

// Show "Most asked" badge on popular questions
```

### **Phase 4: Search**
Add search in bottom sheet:
```typescript
<input 
  type="search"
  placeholder="Search 25 questions..."

## 💡 **Key Design Decisions**

### **Why Progressive Disclosure?**
- ✅ Doesn't overwhelm users with 25 questions at once
- ✅ Guides users to choose topic first (mental model)
- ✅ Reduces cognitive load
- ✅ Mobile-friendly (less scrolling)

### **Why Auto-Hide After First Message?**
- ✅ Keeps chat area clean during conversation
- ✅ User demonstrated they know how to ask questions
- ✅ Still accessible via pill button
- ✅ Doesn't compete with chat messages

### **Why Bottom Sheet Instead of Dropdown?**
- ✅ Native mobile pattern (feels natural)
- ✅ More space for content (70vh)
- ✅ Touch-friendly (swipe to close)
- ✅ Better for 25 questions (scrollable)

### **Why Icon Tabs?**
- ✅ Visual recognition (icons faster than text)
- ✅ Saves space (5 tabs fit in one row)
- ✅ Works with long Vietnamese titles
- ✅ Clear active state

### **Why No Markdown/Truncation?**
- ✅ Farmers need full context to understand question
- ✅ Vietnamese text is longer (needs more space)
- ✅ Better accessibility (no "..." confusion)
- ✅ Mobile screens can handle 2-3 line buttons
