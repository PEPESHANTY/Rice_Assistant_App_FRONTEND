## 🛠️ Technical Details

### What Changed for Publishing

```
App → Supabase Edge Function → OpenAI API
```

```
App → OpenAI API (Direct from Browser)
```

### Benefits of Client-Side Approach
- ✅ Works when published (no backend needed)
- ✅ Faster responses (no intermediary)
- ✅ More secure (no server storing keys)
- ✅ Lower latency
- ✅ You control the API key

### Files Modified
- `/components/SimpleAssistant.tsx` - Direct OpenAI API calls
- `/components/Profile.tsx` - API key settings UI
- API key stored in `localStorage` (key: `openai_api_key`)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "To use AI-powered responses, please add your OpenAI API key..."
- **Solution**: Add your API key in Profile > AI Assistant Settings
- **Note**: IRRI knowledge base still works without API key

### "Invalid OpenAI API key"
- Check that you copied the full key (starts with `sk-`)
- Verify the key is active on OpenAI platform
- Make sure you have credits/billing set up on OpenAI

### AI responses not translating properly
- This is rare - AI is instructed to respond in both languages
- Try rephrasing your question
- Switch to the other language and ask again

### Want to remove API key
- Go to Profile > AI Assistant Settings
- Click "Remove API Key"
- Your key is deleted from browser storage
