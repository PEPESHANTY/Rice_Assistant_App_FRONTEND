3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

### Step 2: Add It to Your Code
1. Open `/components/SimpleAssistant.tsx`
2. Find line 33:
   ```typescript
   const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-openai-api-key-here';
   ```
3. Replace with your actual key:
   ```typescript
   const OPENAI_API_KEY = 'sk-proj-abc123...'; // Your real key
   ```
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test & Publish
1. Test locally:
   - Ask IRRI question → Works instantly (free)
   - Ask custom question → ChatGPT responds (your key)
   - Switch languages → Translates perfectly
2. Click "Publish" in Figma Make

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Your Costs
- **Infrastructure:** $0 (no backend)
- **Hosting:** Free on Figma Make
- **OpenAI:** ~$0-5/month depending on usage

### Per-Question Costs
- IRRI answers: **$0** (100+ questions)
- Simple AI question: **~$0.001**
- Complex AI question: **~$0.005**
- Conversation (5 exchanges): **~$0.015**

### Example Monthly Usage
- 50 IRRI questions: **$0**
- 100 AI questions: **$0.10-0.50**
- 200 AI questions: **$0.20-1.00**
- 500 AI questions: **$0.50-2.50**

**Recommendation:** Set $5-10 monthly limit on OpenAI dashboard

## 🔒 Security

### What's Secure
- ✅ API key embedded in your code
- ✅ Only visible to you during development
- ✅ Minified/bundled when published
- ✅ Sent only to OpenAI (direct HTTPS)
- ✅ Not logged or stored anywhere else

### What to Watch
- ⚠️ Users can technically extract key from browser
- ⚠️ Set spending limits to prevent abuse
- ⚠️ Monitor usage on OpenAI dashboard
- ⚠️ Rotate key if you suspect compromise

### Best Practices
1. **Set budget:** https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits
2. **Monitor usage:** https://platform.openai.com/usage
3. **Use separate key:** Don't reuse keys from other projects
4. **Rotate periodically:** Create new key every few months
