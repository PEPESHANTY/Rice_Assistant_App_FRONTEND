# 🔄 ChatGPT Client-Side Migration Summary

## What Was Changed

Successfully migrated ChatGPT integration from **Supabase Edge Functions** (server-side) to **client-side** OpenAI API calls to enable publishing without backend dependency.

---

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. SimpleAssistant Component (`/components/SimpleAssistant.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Called Supabase Edge Function
const response = await fetch(`https://${projectId}.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-1a31cf30/chat`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${publicAnonKey}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ message, language, conversationHistory })
});
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Direct OpenAI API call from browser
const openaiApiKey = localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key') || '';

const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${openaiApiKey}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
    messages: apiMessages,
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 1200
  })
});
```

### 2. Profile Component (`/components/Profile.tsx`)

**Added:**
- ✅ AI Assistant Settings card
- ✅ OpenAI API key input field (password type with show/hide)
- ✅ Save API Key button
- ✅ Remove API Key button
- ✅ Link to OpenAI platform to get API key
- ✅ Info message explaining local storage
- ✅ Bilingual labels (English & Vietnamese)

**New State:**
```typescript
const [openaiApiKey, setOpenaiApiKey] = useState(localStorage.getItem('openai_api_key') || '');
const [showApiKey, setShowApiKey] = useState(false);
```

**New Handlers:**
```typescript
const handleSaveApiKey = () => {
  localStorage.setItem('openai_api_key', openaiApiKey.trim());
  toast.success(t.apiKeySaved);
};

const handleRemoveApiKey = () => {
  setOpenaiApiKey('');
  localStorage.removeItem('openai_api_key');
  toast.success(t.apiKeyRemoved);
};
```

## 📦 What Still Exists (Unused)

These files remain in the codebase but are **not used** after migration:

- `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx` - Supabase Edge Function (contains old chat endpoint)
- `/supabase/functions/server/kv_store.tsx` - Key-value store utilities
- `/utils/supabase/info.tsx` - Supabase project credentials

**Why keep them?**
- No harm in keeping them
- If you want to switch back to backend approach later
- Can be deleted if desired

---

## 🔑 API Key Storage

### Security Approach

**Where:**
- Stored in browser's `localStorage`
- Key name: `openai_api_key`

**Security:**
- ✅ Stored locally (never sent to any server except OpenAI)
- ✅ Client-side only (your browser controls it)
- ✅ Can be removed anytime
- ✅ Not exposed in source code
- ⚠️ Accessible via browser console (standard for client-side apps)

**Best Practices:**
1. Use a separate OpenAI API key for this app
2. Set spending limits on OpenAI dashboard
3. Don't share your published app URL if you want to keep costs private
4. Can revoke/rotate the key anytime on OpenAI platform

---

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### Without API Key
1. User opens app
2. Asks question in Assistant
3. **IRRI knowledge base responds** (if question matches)
4. If no match → Error message: *"To use AI-powered responses, please add your OpenAI API key in Profile"*

### With API Key
1. User goes to **Profile > AI Assistant Settings**
2. Gets API key from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
3. Pastes key and clicks **Save**
4. Returns to Assistant
5. Asks any question
6. **IRRI knowledge base checks first** (free, instant)
7. If no match → **ChatGPT responds** (uses their API key)

## ✅ Benefits of This Approach

### For Publishing
- ✅ **Works when published** - No Supabase backend needed
- ✅ **No infrastructure** - Static hosting only
- ✅ **No server costs** - Users pay for their own API usage
- ✅ **Easy deployment** - Just publish to Figma Make hosting

### For Users
- ✅ **Privacy** - API key stays in their browser
- ✅ **Control** - They can add/remove key anytime
- ✅ **Transparency** - They see exactly what's being charged
- ✅ **Optional** - App works great without AI (IRRI knowledge base)

### For You (Developer)
- ✅ **No API key management** - Users bring their own
- ✅ **No billing** - You don't pay for OpenAI calls
- ✅ **No rate limiting** - Each user has their own quota
- ✅ **Scalable** - Unlimited users without infrastructure

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Without API Key
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.removeItem('openai_api_key')`
2. Ask question from IRRI knowledge base → Should work
3. Ask custom question → Should show error about API key

### Test With API Key
1. Go to Profile > AI Assistant Settings
2. Add test API key (get from OpenAI)
3. Save and return to Assistant
4. Ask custom question → Should get AI response
5. Check that response is bilingual

### Test Key Removal
1. Go back to Profile
2. Click "Remove API Key"
3. Verify key is cleared from localStorage
4. Try asking AI question → Should show error
