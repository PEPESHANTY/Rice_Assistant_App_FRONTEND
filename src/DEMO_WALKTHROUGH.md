## 📞 Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is the image analysis real AI?**
A: This prototype uses filename-based detection. Production would use computer vision models trained on rice disease datasets (e.g., TensorFlow.js, GPT-4 Vision API).

**Q: Where does the expert knowledge come from?**
A: International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) - the world's leading rice research organization. We've integrated their handbooks and technical guidelines.

**Q: Why phone number instead of email?**
A: Many Vietnamese farmers don't have email addresses. Phone is universal and familiar.

**Q: Can it work offline?**
A: Not yet. Roadmap includes offline mode with cached responses and sync when online.

**Q: How do you ensure advice is location-specific?**
A: User's province/district data + weather integration + IRRI's region-specific guidelines.

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: All farmer data would be encrypted. Images are processed and not stored long-term. Clear privacy policy in farmer's language.
