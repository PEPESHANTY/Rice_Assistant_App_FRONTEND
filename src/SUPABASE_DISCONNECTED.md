2. **Test all features** - Everything works client-side
3. **Share with farmers** - App is production-ready

## 💡 Future Backend (Optional)

If you want to add backend features later (user accounts, data persistence, etc.), you can:

1. **Reconnect Supabase** - Use proper authentication and database
2. **Use another backend** - Firebase, AWS, or custom server
3. **Keep it client-side** - Use browser localStorage for persistence

For now, your app works perfectly without any backend! 🌾✨
