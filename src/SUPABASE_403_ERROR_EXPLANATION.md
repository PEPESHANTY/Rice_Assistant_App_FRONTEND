# Supabase 403 Error - Safe to Ignore

## ⚠️ What's Happening?

You're seeing this error:
```
Error while deploying: XHR for "/api/integrations/supabase/Lt4eSHqlkArtZ2Cwiql4fB/edge_functions/make-server/deploy" failed with status 403
```

## ✅ This Error is HARMLESS

**Your app works perfectly!** This error only affects unused Supabase edge functions that your app **does not use**.

## 🎯 Why This Happens

1. **Supabase edge functions exist** in `/supabase/functions/server/`
2. **But your app uses client-side OpenAI calls** (hardcoded API key in SimpleAssistant.tsx)
3. **The deployment tries to update these functions** but lacks permissions
4. **Your app never calls these functions**, so the error doesn't affect functionality

## 🚀 How to Proceed

### Option 1: Ignore the Error (Recommended)
Simply **click "Continue" or "Dismiss"** on the error popup. Your app will work perfectly!

### Option 2: Disconnect Supabase (If You Don't Need It)
If you're not using Supabase at all:
1. Go to Figma Make project settings
2. Disconnect the Supabase integration
3. Your app will work without this error

### Option 3: Fix Supabase Permissions (Advanced)
Only if you want to use Supabase later:
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Check project permissions
3. Verify you have "Service Role" access
4. Re-authenticate the connection
