## 🚀 How to Use (No Setup Required!)

### Step 1: Get FREE API Key

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (completely free for basic use)
3. Verify your email
4. Go to **"API keys"** section in your account
5. Copy your API key (looks like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6`)

### Step 2: Configure API Key

Open `/config/weather.ts` and replace the placeholder:

```typescript
export const WEATHER_CONFIG = {
  // Replace with your OpenWeatherMap API key
  API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',  // 👈 Paste your key here
  
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Step 3: Done! 🎉

That's it! The app will automatically:
- ✅ Request location permission from the user
- ✅ Fetch real weather data for their location
- ✅ Update weather every time they click refresh
- ✅ Fall back to Mekong Delta location if permission denied

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Location Detection

The app uses the browser's **Geolocation API**:

```javascript
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(...)
```

**User Flow:**
1. App loads → Requests location permission
2. User grants permission → Uses exact GPS coordinates
3. User denies permission → Falls back to default (An Giang, Vietnam)
4. User clicks refresh → Re-fetches weather for current/default location

### Weather Data

The app fetches:

- **Current conditions**: temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed
- **5-day forecast**: daily high/low, rainfall, conditions
- **Alerts**: Heavy rain warnings, high temperature alerts

### API Limits (Free Tier)

OpenWeatherMap Free Plan:
- ✅ **60 calls/minute**
- ✅ **1,000,000 calls/month**
- ✅ More than enough for a demo/prototype!

---

## 🌍 Default Location

If location permission is denied, the app defaults to:

```typescript
DEFAULT_LOCATION: {
  latitude: 10.0452,   // An Giang Province
  longitude: 105.4340, // Mekong Delta, Vietnam
  name: 'An Giang'
}
```

You can change this in `/config/weather.ts`.

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### For Demo/Prototype (Current Setup)
✅ API key stored in frontend code
✅ Good for testing and demonstrations
⚠️ API key visible to anyone inspecting the code

### For Production (Recommended)
When deploying to production, you should:

1. **Move API key to backend** (Supabase Edge Functions, serverless functions, etc.)
2. **Use environment variables** (`.env` file, not committed to git)
3. **Add rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
4. **Implement caching** to reduce API calls

Example with Supabase Edge Function:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/get-weather/index.ts
const API_KEY = Deno.env.get('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY');

Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const { latitude, longitude } = await req.json();
  
  const weatherData = await fetch(
    `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=${latitude}&lon=${longitude}&appid=${API_KEY}`
  );
  
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(await weatherData.json()));
});
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Location Detection

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for logs:
   - `"Geolocation not available or denied"` → Permission denied
   - Weather location should show your city name

### Test Weather Refresh

1. Click the refresh button (🔄 icon in top-right)
2. Should show spinning animation
3. Weather data updates
4. Check console for any errors

### Test API Configuration

1. **Without API key**: Shows blue banner "Demo Mode: Using mock weather data"
2. **With API key**: No banner, shows real weather data
3. **Invalid API key**: Falls back to mock data, check console for error

## 📱 Features

### ✅ What Works Now

- Current weather conditions with temperature, humidity, wind
- 5-day forecast with daily high/low
- Weather alerts (heavy rain, high temperature)
- Automatic location detection
- Manual refresh button
- Loading states with animation
- Bilingual Vietnamese/English support
- Responsive mobile-first design

### 🎯 Weather Conditions Detected

The app intelligently provides farming recommendations based on:

- **Good conditions** (20-35°C, 50-80% humidity, no rain)
  - Best time to spray: Early morning (5-8 AM)
  - Good conditions for irrigation
  
- **Fair conditions** (mild deviations)
  - General farming activities okay
  
- **Poor conditions** (heavy rain, extreme temperatures)
  - Avoid field work during rain
  - High temperature alert for irrigation

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Weather API key not configured"
→ Make sure you replaced `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` in `/config/weather.ts`

### "API request failed"
→ Check your API key is valid
→ Check you're not exceeding rate limits
→ Verify internet connection

### "Geolocation not available"
→ Browser may not support geolocation (rare)
→ User may be on HTTP (not HTTPS) - geolocation requires HTTPS
→ Falls back to default location automatically

### Weather shows "Loading..." forever
→ Open browser console to see error messages
→ API key might be invalid
→ Falls back to mock data automatically

## 💡 Tips

1. **Free tier is enough**: 1M calls/month = ~380 calls per user per month
2. **Cache weather data**: Consider caching for 10-15 minutes to reduce API calls
3. **Error handling**: App gracefully falls back to mock data if API fails
4. **Mobile users**: Location works great on mobile devices
5. **Offline mode**: Mock data ensures app still works without internet

**Q: Do I need a credit card?**
A: No credit card required for the free tier.

**Q: What if I exceed the limit?**
A: App falls back to mock data. Upgrade your plan or implement caching.

**Q: Can I use a different weather API?**
A: Yes! Edit `/components/AppContext.tsx` and update the `fetchRealTimeWeather` function.

**Q: Does it work on localhost?**
A: Yes, but geolocation works best on HTTPS. Most modern browsers allow it on `localhost` for testing.

**Q: Can I deploy this?**
A: Yes! Works on any hosting platform. For production, move API key to environment variables.
